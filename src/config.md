### To use:

1) Open the card browser

3) Go to "Edit > Copy Notes in place" or "Edit > Full note copy"

Both option consider the note you did select, and create a new note with the same content. (Fields and tags)
Both option add the card of the copied note to the deck in which the original card is (this is 
the main difference with addon 396494452)

"Copy notes in place" creates cards which are new. Empty cards are not copied.
